After rewatching the original [Ghost in the Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_in_the_Shell) anime I was particularly inspired by the cyberpunk aesthetic and was determined to introduce the third axis into a generative art piece.

Points are randomly assigned within the constraints of a function which models a 3D pyramidal structure. Wireframe boxes are then generated at these points and they're size varies varies according to a random function seeded by their position within the structure. A simple rotation function produces the camera effect.
