After being particularly inspired to leave the canvas after sitting down one day and laboring over combining oils in the proper proportions to form desired colors, I decided to purchase a [Wacom Intuos](https://www.wacom.com/en-in/products/pen-tablets/intuos) and ramp up to speed on my traditional artistic training in the new medium.

William Maughan's [The Artist's Complete Guide to Drawing the Head](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CVS453C/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) seemed like an equally interesting and challenging starting point (and, facial form in my opinion requires a synthesis of core traditional concepts of form, texture, value, etc.).

I began by getting "retrofitting" my tablet setup to a medium I was familiar with, and chose rough grained paper with charcoal. The text walks the reader through the importance of achieving 4 non-paper values and treating the paper itself as a value.

After establishing a relatively comfortable rendering of the values described by the text in the tablet I began familiarizing with the form of the human face by utilizing Line of Action's [open source repo](https://line-of-action.com/practice-tools/face-expression-practice/) of facial expression photos to perform timed drawings meant to capture the essence and provide grounds for self-critique.

After 4 hours over the course of the week spent performing gesture drawings and critique I spent roughly 3 hours carving out the portrait above.
