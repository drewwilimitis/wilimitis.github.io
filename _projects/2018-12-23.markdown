I produced this render using the lighting engine I've constructed over the past several months.

This is the last image to be produced on this engine as I'm currently crafting another iteration (built primarily for SIGGRAPH paper experimentation) from the ground up with support for more general bdrfs, procedural textures, and photon mapping (among other goodies).

See my previous posts, [indirect illumination i]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/2018-12-14) and [model renderer]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/2018-12-10), for context on how the engine was constructed.
