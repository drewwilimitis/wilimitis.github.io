A foray into the realm of procedurally generated art.

I had begun my journey by following along with Daniel Shiffman's wonderful open source work, [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/introduction/), and was particularly inspired by Perlin noise as it is the first mathematical structure which instilled in me a feeling of unity between traditional artistic concepts (form, in this case) and a technological medium.

The particular design was inspired by the cover of the [Acid Disk EP](https://www.discogs.com/G-Jones-Eprom-Acid-Disk-EP/master/1306973) released by G Jones & Eprom on Illusory Records.
