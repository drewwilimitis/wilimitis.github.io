[source code](https://github.com/wilimitis/aspect)

aspect is a minimalistic application designed to enable the user to store notes in recursive tree structure. Such a structure, I believe, models the most natural way in which the mind access information, for example

Root
- Programming
  - JavaScript
    - p5.js
- Exercise
  - Yoga
    - Vinyasa
      - Chaturanga Dandasana
        - ...

aspect was designed for both Android and iOS using React Native and Redux.
